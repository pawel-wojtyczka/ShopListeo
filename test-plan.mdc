# Test Plan for ShopListeo

## Overview
This document outlines the test plan for ShopListeo, a web application built using Astro 5, TypeScript 5, React 19, Tailwind 4, and Shadcn/ui. The test plan provides a comprehensive strategy for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application through various testing methodologies.

## Objectives
- Validate that the application meets the business requirements.
- Ensure that individual components and integrations work as expected.
- Identify defects early in the development process.
- Maintain high code quality and prevent regressions.

## Scope
The testing scope includes:
- Unit tests for individual components and functions.
- Integration tests to verify component interaction.
- End-to-end tests simulating real-world user scenarios.
- Performance and accessibility tests as needed.

## Test Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Utilize Jest and React Testing Library.
- Test individual components and functions in isolation.
- Mock external dependencies as necessary.

### Integration Testing
- Verify correct data flow among components.
- Test interactions between modules.
- Use Jest for integration tests.

### End-to-End Testing
- Employ Cypress (or a similar tool like Playwright) to simulate user scenarios.
- Automate critical user journeys such as product search, user registration, and checkout.

### Performance Testing (Optional)
- Monitor load times and resource usage.
- Use tools like Lighthouse for performance evaluation.

### Accessibility Testing
- Use axe-core or similar tools to ensure compliance with WCAG guidelines.
